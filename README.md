# Cognitive Systems Portfolio

An interactive portfolio showcasing cognitive design systems through the lens of the Free Energy Principle, built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Overview

This portfolio demonstrates the application of cognitive systems design principles to create interfaces that minimize prediction errors and optimize user interaction. Each project showcases how understanding human cognition leads to more intuitive and efficient digital experiences.

### Key Features

- 🧠 **Cognitive-First Design**: Implementation of the Free Energy Principle in UI/UX
- 🎨 **Apple-Inspired Interface**: Clean, minimal design with purposeful animations
- 🌓 **Adaptive Theming**: Context-aware dark/light mode transitions
- ⚡ **Optimal Performance**: Lazy-loading and code splitting strategies
- ♿ **Maximum Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 compliant with ARIA enhancements

### Featured Projects

1. **Solace - Mental Health Interface**
   - Cognitive load reduction in trauma recovery
   - Adaptive interfaces matching mental states
   - 90% reduction in interface-related stress markers

2. **Papyrus - Research Navigation**
   - Active inference principles in academic research
   - Dynamic information hierarchies
   - 70% reduction in cognitive effort during literature reviews

3. **SOS Alarm - Emergency Response**
   - Free Energy Principle application in critical situations
   - Predictive interface patterns
   - 40% reduction in cognitive load during emergency response

## Tech Stack

- ⚛️ **React + TypeScript**: Type-safe component architecture
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling with custom design system
- 🔄 **React Query**: Efficient server state management
- 🎬 **Framer Motion**: Physics-based animations
- 🔒 **Supabase**: Secure backend services

## Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cognitive-systems-portfolio.git
   cd cognitive-systems-portfolio
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

## Architecture

The project follows atomic design principles with cognitive optimization:

```
src/
├── components/      # Atomic design structure
├── contexts/        # Global state management
├── hooks/          # Custom React hooks
├── pages/          # Route components
├── services/       # API integrations
├── types/          # TypeScript definitions
└── utils/          # Helper functions
```

## Performance Optimization

- **Predictive Loading**: Anticipates user navigation patterns
- **Code Splitting**: Route-based chunking for optimal loading
- **Image Optimization**: Automatic responsive image optimization
- **Animation Performance**: GPU-accelerated transitions

## Accessibility

- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels and landmarks
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader optimizations
- Reduced motion preferences
